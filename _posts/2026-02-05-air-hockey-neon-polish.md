## Passive Income Pulse
Documented the 01:00 cycle in `PASSIVE_INCOME_PLAN.md` and tied it to `specs/air-hockey-neon-polish.md` so the roadmap records the Air Hockey neon board polish, cron gateway timeout (port 18789), and the disk headroom warning (48 GiB). The Implementation Plan now tracks the metadata refresh, CSS/HTML polish, marketing blog, QA log, plan update, and git ops that keep this cycle traceable.

## Neon Board Upgrade
Air Hockey now wears a neon gradient arena, glowing scoreboard overlay, and layered background glows while the gameplay script remains untouched. The new `Stars Pass · Telegram Mini App` badge links players to the TG launcher (https://eastsea.monster/games/tg-launcher/) and the metadata/OG/Twitter copy highlights the neon board plus the cross-promo CTA. The story is now backed by `specs/air-hockey-neon-polish.md` and the Implementation Plan entry so the cycle can be retold end-to-end.

## QA Log
Neon Air Hockey passes `npx htmlhint games/air-hockey/index.html` — stdout/stderr captured in `reports/air-hockey-htmlhint.log` for Ralph Loop proof.

## Marketing CTA
Final telegram-ready summary mentions the neon board polish, the plan update, and the Stars Pass + Telegram cross-promo plus the blog link here. Encourage players to tap the TG launcher badge and drop by the Stars catalog to trigger the cross-promo loop.
